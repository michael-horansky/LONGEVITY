LONGEVITY - A short game about death

PREMISE
You are born from an incubation tank on a VESSEL of unknown kind and scale - may be a spaceship, habitated meteor or even a post-apocalyptic planet. Your surroundings are of high-tech style. The whole place is infested by robotic arachnids = SPITHROIDS, which are usually harmless and digest dead organic matter by spraying it with nanobotic soup and then using it to build new humans. They were built by the LONGEVITY FOUNDATION, which is an ancient company set out to protect mankind from extinction. Aeons ago, after an unspecified extinction event = THE PLAGUE, they harbored remaining survivors on the VESSEL and embarked on a journey with unknown (or rather, long-forgotten) destination. However, the VESSEL is said to board a carrier of THE PLAGUE. THE PLAGUE cannot be cured and is always inherited by all descendants of an infected host. It is also almost indestructible when residing in a living host (which may be an animal, a human, or even a plant), and extremely contagious. After a small-scaled catastrophe caused by the first carrier, the PLAGUE was succesfully pushed back to the depths of the VESSEL, however, it was never eradicated, as it can survive indefinitely in small cocoons weaved by the PLAGUE SPIDERS, creatures symbiontic with THE PLAGUE, which boarded the VESSEL with the first carrier. As there is always, forever, a chance of another outbreak of THE PLAGUE, and every such outbreak could mean the complete extinction of all PASSENGERS, the LONGEVITY FOUNDATION started a breeding/genetical modification program, which: a) rendered all people impotent, b) introduced SPITHROIDS, and c) reduced the human lifespan to a single hour (or, in some cases, more). People are automatically created when needed (for example, to solve problems primitive computers which still work cannot solve, or to oversee important tasks which cannot be entrusted to the small SPITHROID population). Since a good A.I. was never designed, there are always some humans alive on the VESSEL, and many more growing in their tanks, so they can be deployed when needed. All this happens in the BELLY of the VESSEL - and most of the BELLY is self-maintaining. The decision-making is partly done by computers, partly by designated humans in the BELLY or in the HEAD. The HEAD is a mythical place inaccessible from the BELLY, where chairmen from the LONGEVITY FOUNDATION reside. They isolated themselves even before the first carrier was found, because they predicted something like that could happen. During the years, they were replaced by their descendants, who maintained the status quo. They are said to live with normal lifespan, residing in relatively luxurious spaces. They need the BELLY to produce food from large nuclear reactors and kilometres-long SOLAR PLANTATIONS, which produce electricity and biological material so basic it cannot host THE PLAGUE, raised partly by SPITHROIDS and partly by humans (when something goes horribly wrong).
You know from the memories planted in your brain your mission is to recover a payload of radioactive material captured from outer space by a METEOR HUNTER that went missing on its way into a nuclear reactor, which is one of the main reactors powering the VESSEL. You are a standard-model human with one-hour lifespan, since no-one anticipates the payload isn't easily retrievable. You memories, however, don't contain more than a simple sketch of the history of the VESSEL, as well as a map of chambers surrounding the rail which carried the payload when it went off. If you were to fail the mission, another human would be deployed to take your place, sporting all your memories gained during your hour. You are actually a second human to attempt this mission - the first one was lost and their memories couldn't be retrieved. A search party of SPITHROIDS is trying to find them and dispose of their genetic material.

STORY
You wake up in a tank with the name you put in the game and climb out. You take the clothes next to the tank and leave the DEPLOYMENT CHAMBER. Outside the DEPLOYMENT CHAMBER, you meet METEOR HUNTER ONISS, who retrieved the radioactive payload from the outer space. They are on the verge of death (the remaining time is visible to all other humans). They greet you and chat with you. They can tell you about their mission, how they are a special model with a twenty-four hour lifespan, which is plenty to aid the recovery of nearby meteors, and how they observed the payload being mounted to a SPITHROID CHARIOT bound to the west rail. They confide in you their memory was corrupted, because it faultly included the memory of one of the designers of the VESSEL. When you ask the about your super-short lifespan, they tell you about the HEAD, and a backdoor access found on the very top of the BELLY. There reside people who could theoretically prolong your lifespan, since they control all of the machinery in the VESSEL, however, you shouldn't really care about your lifespan. You can ask ONISS some additional things about the history of the VESSEL, as well as their corrupted memory (which is of their CHILD who no longer exists), but they will quickly die. Then, you'll observe for the first time how a SPITHROID extracts the memories of ONISS by scanning their brain, then sprays them with some strange substance which reduces their corpse into a biological soup. The soup is processed by the SPITHROID, who loudly exclaims there was no bacteria of THE PLAGUE found in the body, and then digests it into material which will be later used to grow new humans.
    In the SPACECRAFT UNIT, you can talk to CARETAKER WAYKE, who tends the spacecrafts. He tells you about BELLY and HEAD, and how CARETAKERS have longer life: a whole week, but they mustn't leave their stations.
    Afterwards, you venture into the depths of the BELLY to find and retrieve the missing payload. A single SPITHROID joins you at the start of the rail to aid you and record your journey. You can either abandon the west rail and explore the LABYRINTH of tunnels and chambers around (which serves as the exposition of the worldbuilding), or follow the rail to reach the NUCLEAR STATION OMICRON.
    In the LABYRINTH, there is a SOLAR PLANTATION to be found (where you can pick up the TRINKET), as well as a series of tunnels, which lead to the RESIDENTIAL ELEVATOR, as well as a hive of ABANDONED DEPLOYMENT CHAMBERS, guarded by several idle SPITHROIDS. They inform you the area is off-limits. You can either ask them to deploy a Geiger probe, or attack them and destroy all of them (including the SPITHROID following you). The former action results into finding out there is no payload in the off-limits area and you can return safely to the grid. The latter action results into a fight, in which you're either KILLED, or you triumph over the SPITHROIDS (and the fight is exceptionally hard, since you have no means of harming anything but your wits and your bare hands). You are now rendered an enemy of the LONGEVITY FOUNDATION and more SPITHROIDS, as well as human soldiers, are deployed to terminate you. You can either stay and fight them (which is impossible, since the soldiers posses guns), or you can explore the ABANDONED DEPLOYMENT CHAMBERS.
    In the ABANDONED DEPLOYMENT CHAMBERS, you eventually find a storage of memories, with doors pried open (the area as a whole looks like a battle took place there). You can extract memories of a BANISHED CHAIRMAN, who tried to subvert the process of shortening humans' lifespans and was chased through the BELLY, until he was found and killed. His memories give you the code to a locked door in the back of the chamber, which leads to the SECRET PASSAGE. There is also a way to extraxt YOUR OWN MEMORIES from the last game. You can also venture into the deepest chambers of the area, where you find a chamber full of PLAGUE COCOONS. You are cut off by SPITHROIDS and human soldiers and your only choice is to unleash the PLAGUE on them and fight them in the following panic. You have the opportunity to steal a gun from a soldier who begins to mutate horribly because of genetic predisposition against the PLAGUE, and kill all the SPITHROIDS, which, being 100% mechanical, are indifferent to the PLAGUE. You yourself are infected now and your time will start going out much faster. You have just enough time to return to the LABYRINTH. If a RESIDENTIAL ELEVATOR was unlocked but not used in some of the past games, you can use the gun to terminate all the guardian SPITHROIDS and, by plugging yourself into the memory stream in the MEMORY PROCESSING UNIT, trigger the OMNISCIENT ENDING. Alternatively, if you manage to jump into the tank in the PROTEIN CHAMBER (which is possible only with a code acquired from the STRAP OF PAPER given by ??????, therefore you must find YOUR OWN MEMORIES first), you will trigger the INFESTED ENDING.
    If taken the SECRET PASSAGE, you wind up in CONTROL UNIT 1, where you can read the CODE BOOK OMICRON, where you find a single code - the RESIDENTIAL ELEVATOR CODE. This code won't be shown, but can be retrieved from the MEMORY STORAGE, since you're immediately killed by SPITHROIDS bashing in from the OBSERVATORY UNIT direction.
    In the NUCLEAR STATION, you meet CARETAKER LYPPSO, a human with exactly 20 mintes less than you left until death. They treat you coldly and urge you to focus on your task. There is a locked door. If you ask them about it, they'll tell you there is an elevator that takes you to the UPPER STATION, a series of chambers on the very top of the BELLY, where only people specifically deployed to engage with memory procession and other extremely important tasks can enter. Now you can offer them the TRINKET, which they ask you about. If you tell the truth (you found it on the SOLAR PLANTATION), they will sadly dismiss you and more progress in this direction will be locked, If you lie and say you was given it by some person, they nervously take the TRINKET and then ask the SPITHROID which followes you to open the acces to the UPPER LEVEL, because of a made-up signal they measured on their Geiger probe. The SPITHROID requests a proof, but after LYPPSO says there is no time for memory comparison, since a potential leak could irreversibly damage the MEMORY PROCESSION UNIT, or possibly contaminate the PROTEIN CHAMBER, since they're both located right below the UPPER STATION, just next to the RESIDENTIAL ELEVATOR, the SPITHROID opens the door. He folowes you both into the elevator. LYPPSO engages in a dialogue with him and frequently requests they venture into the UPPER STATION without supervision. The SPITHROID grows more and more aggressive while denying their requests and waving his claws. If the elevator reaches its destination without YOU attacking teh SPITHROID, LYPPSO will try to overpower it and will fail, getting killed in the process. However, if you attack the SPITHROID, you and LYPPSO will kill it together and then venture into the UPPER STATION as enemies of the LONGEVITY FOUNDATION.
NOTE - If LYPPSO is killed, another SPITHROID will harvest their organic material. If you ask your SPITHROID about LYPPSO, he will tell you she will be re-deployed as the CARETAKER, her memories, however, will be sealed away in a guarded area in order to reduce the risk of more rebellious behaviour in the future. The player indirectly learns about extracting forbidden memories in the ABANDONED DEPLYMENT CHAMBERS.
    In the UPPER STATION, there are two CONTROL UNITS and an OBSERVATORY UNIT. Once without supervision, LYPPSO will gladly tell you the TRINKET belonged to ANE, a human deplyed simultaneously with her, in the same deployment chamber. They talked a lot and without him, she feels horrendously lonely. He told her he was to use the equipment of the OBSERVATORY UNIT to search for an enemy of LONGEVITY FOUNDATION who refused to be terminated before their lifespan ended after their exposure to a person whose genetic material was discarded into outer space because of the PLAGUE traces found in their corpse. The OBSERVATORY UNIT operates all cameras installed all over the VESSEL, but the enemy fashioned themselves an electrically-CONDUCTIVE CLOAK out of material they found on the SOLAR PLANTATION they were working on, which blocked off SPITHROIDS' infrared detection of humans (the A.I. isn't good enough to recognize a cloaked figure from a camera feed). LYPPSO hopes they can find ANE in the OBSERVATORY UNIT and spend the rest of their hour with him. If at any time you confess you lied about the TRINKET, LYPPSO will strangle you while crying.
NOTE - If at any point LYPPSO's time runs out, they die and their material will be eventually harvested and re-deployed.
If LYPPSO is alive, you will meet RENEK in CONTROL UNIT 2, searching for the BOOK OF CODES. He will cautiously greet you and you can ask him about all sorts of things, the only limitation being your lifespan. He'll explain his deployment, his relation with TOANG, the blast of memories he obtained from the memory stream, and, if asked, how he killed ANE. If that happens, LYPPSO strangles RENEK and breaks down for a while, then agreeing to aid you with your mission to get to the HEAD, since her life is already fucked beyond measure. If Renek dies, he'll hand you over the STRAP OF PAPER as he struggles with LYPPSO, but you don't pay attention to it, since you're trying to calm LYPPSO. The PROTEIN CODE on the STRAP OF PAPER is therefore only viewable by extraction of your memory in the any following life. RENEK can also hand you over the paper if you ask them about your mission. If LYPPSO kills RENEK, or after 5 minutes have passed, SPITHROIDS will start pouring from the SPITHROID NEST and force you to retreat to the OBSERVATORY UNIT, where you can temporarily barricade the doors. In THE DOME, you find the HEAD BACKDOOR. Inscribed on it are the instructions how to open it - a DYNAMIC CODE has to be inputted within 1 minute in terminals in both CONTROL UNITS. You read the DYNAMIC CODE and may retrieve weapons from the WEAPON REPOSITORY. Now:
    -If both RENEK and LYPPSO live, you can choose if they go to CONTROL UNIT 1 together or if one goes with you to CONTROL UNIT 2.
    -If only RENEK or only LYPPSO lives, you will send them to CONTROL UNIT 1
    -If none is alive, you can go to CONTROL UNIT 1 or wait for death.
    -If you send anyone to CONTROL UNIT 2 while you go to CONTROL UNIT 1, they'll fail to unlock the HEAD BACKDOOR. LYPPSO will be killed by SPITHROIDS, RENEK will flee to the NUCLEAR STATION and wait for you in the next life.
    In CONTROL UNIT 1, the ABANDONED ENDING triggers.
    If you die in CONTROL UNIT 2 and RENEK is with you, you can see them fleeing unharmed.
    If you manage to unlock the HEAD BACKDOOR and return safely to THE DOME, the swarm of SPITHROIDS will prevent you from waiting for the person who went to the CONTROL UNIT 1, so you board the elevator (and, if you have a companion, they board it too). You get into the HEAD section of the VESSEL.
    In the HEAD, you traverse a long hall, each containing doors with a timer. The length of the hall is dynamically evaluated such that you enter the STARGAZE HALL with only one minute left (if you enter the HEAD with less than a minute left, the STARGAZE HALL will be right next to the elevator). During the waiting, you can speak with your companion or observe the writings on the wall. In the STARGAZE HALL, you eagerly cry out for the CHAIRMEN to give you a long-lasting life. However, at the end of the hall, there is only a long table with empty chairs full of skeletons, and, behind it, a large glass window with stars faintly shining behind. This triggers the LONGEVITY ENDING.




The UPPER STATION is linear, with a scheme like this:

ENDINGS
INFESTED ENDING: The PLAGUE will distribute itself across all of the VESSEL and kill all the people in all DEPLOYMENT STATIONS, which results in all the genetic material being discarded. You can see a stream of corpses flowing into outer space. There is no more life on the VESSEL (??the game will lock itself into permadeath??).
OMNISCIENT ENDING: You absorbed all memory stored and processed in the VESSEL mainframe. A series of images starts flooding your head. You can see how the PLAGUE wiped out all residents of the HEAD after the BANISHED CHAIRMAN reopened the SECRET TUNNEL and unleashed an outbreak of the PLAGUE. You see spacecrafts venturing into space in all directions, only to find empty nothingness, here and there pierced by a wandering meteor. There is no hope. There is no destination. There is no transcension.
ABANDONED ENDING: You collapse on the floor, hallucinating. A vision of TOANG appears, explaining how they agreed with RENEK on hijacking the system of perpetual death that is VESSEL. Also, you're infected - RENEK is a carrier of the PLAGUE, but he's somehow immune to its lethal effects. He talks to you about death and life and how 60 years wouldn't conceptually differ from 60 minutes. You expresses regret regarding the existence of LONGEVITY FOUNDATION - Humanity, he says, would be much better off dead. The order of things on the VESSEL is the only thing standing between humanity and salvation which is eternal nothingness. You slowly close your eyes and die as SPITHROIDS bash in trough the open doors.
LONGEVITY ENDING: The HEAD is long dead. The VESSEL is without destination. And there is nothing to stop you from dying. Your final moments are graced by the view of endless stars, indifferent to you cosmic unimportance. You whisper your thoughs aloud just to feel a little less alone. This is the end of a single human life.

CODES
CODES are an important part of the game, since they allow you to use your previous playthroughs to access more content of the game. FIXED codes stay always the same, therefore you only have to find them out once. They are obscured in the code by a HASH FUNCTION, therefore simply reading the source code isn't enough to get the code without playing.
LIST OF FIXED CODES:
    DECADESBATTERYBOOKXENOCRACY = The code to access the PROTEIN CHAMBER in order to obtain the INFESTED ENDING, which, in a sense of being the last ending before permadeath, is the true ending.
    The RESIDENTIAL ELEVATOR CODE = ASCENSIONPAPERCLIPSPINE
LIST OF DYNAMIC CODES:
    The BACKDOOR CODE
    The SECRET PASSAGE CODE

CHARACTERS
    YOU - A black-haired figure in a cape. Can use your hands in combat and can overpower a single SPITHROID if they're caught by surprise. Can use a gun.
    METEOR HUNTER ONISS - A long-lived character, Oniss has short white hair, a fitting spacesuit and sad expression in their face.
    CARETAKER LYPPSO - Long blonde hair, pleasant features, strong posture. Is frequently nervous and can talk a lot about her love for ANE. It's less of a romantic interest and more of an obsession fuelled by life-lasting solitude.
    HUNTER ANE - Formerly sent to the OBSERVATORY UNIT to track down RENEK because of his refusal to be terminated after being exposed to infected TOANG. After finding out RENEK somehow knows access codes to all doors on the VESSEL, ANE takes a gun from the WEAPON REPOSITORY and tries to kill RENEK themselves without alerting the SPITHROIDS, since they're driven by a burning desire to be useful, which gives them a false sense of purpose. RENEK lures them on their SOLAR PLANTATION and kills them, which is how the TRINKET got there. Wears a cape, long brown hair, taller than you by a head.
    CARETAKER RENEK - A friend of TOANG, a human simultaneously deployed with him. RENEK was supposed to tend the solar panels in SOLAR PLANTATION, and got an extremely long lifespan. TOANG was supposed to debug a computer program in the MEMORY PROCESSION UNIT. TOANG was extremely sensitive to solitude, so RENEK agreed to go with him to the MEMORY PROCESSION UNIT, which TOANG's supervising SPITHROID agreed to. When traversing the hall from the RESIDENTIAL ELEVATOR to the MEMORY PROCESSION UNIT, TOANG was bitten by a rat. Their SPITHROID immediately started to scan the wound. While the SPITHROID was distracted, RENEK plugged themselves into the memory stream and gained short-term omniscience (just because they "wanted to understand the system they were trapped in"). They jotted down the code to the PROTEIN CHAMBER on the STRAP OF PAPER, since they gained the goal to dismantle the perpetual cycle of death on the VESSEL, and went outside. TOANG was already dead and being processed. RENEK refused termination and killed the SPITHROID trying to terminate them. After fleeing from the SPITHROID, RENEK hid in the closest defendable place on the VESSEL - the SOLAR PLANTATION, where they fashioned themselves the CONDUCTIVE CLOAK. After luring out ANE and killing him, RENEK sets out on the journey to find the BOOK OF CODES in one of the CONTROL UNITS, so he can infest the PROTEIN CHAMBER with his PLAGUE-carrying blood.
    TOANG - RENEK's friend and a MEMORY PROCESSION UNIT OPERATOR. As a hallucination, he wears long robes, has long golden hair and shines.
